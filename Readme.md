This is a simple login system I have made using python.

I actually have already made a login system in python which you can check out at https://github.com/codelearnern/SimpleLoginSystem

However, this version uses a database and SQL queries to retrieve data, not storing in a txt file which i did in the previous login system
Also, this uses hashing on the password, which makes it more secure.

Hope you like it and please give any suggestions!
